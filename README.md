# [OS] Mini Project - OS Scheduler
A basic OS scheduler implementing some of the most common scheduling algorithms implemented in python.
- Provides some statistics.
- A simple Gui.
- Handles both context switching and quantum time of CPU.
- A process generator that generates processes with parameters with random distributions.

## Implemented algorithms:

```list
1- Non-preemtive First Come First Serve (FCFS).
2- Non-preemtive Height Priority First (HPF).
3- Preemptive Round Robin (RR).
4- Preemptive Shortest Time Remanining Next (STRN).
```

## Statistics:

```list
1- Process waiting time.
2- Process turn around time.
3- Process weight turn around time.
4- Average turn around time.
5- Average weighted turn around time.
```
